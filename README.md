## FAQs

### What is Delectables by Foodmasku?
- A growing collection of food masked people - all photos are high resolution and generated on the blockchain with verified randomness.

### How many will be generated?
- Between 2000 to 8000 maximum Delectables could exist. 
- Because foodmasku makes meals into masks and then eats them, the ingredients also depend on the four seasons. 
- If Season 1 sells out, work will begin on Season 2. If Season 2 sells out, work will begin on Season 3, and so on for Season 4. 
- Each proceeding season will have 2000 more Delectables, up to 8,000 total for the collection within a one-year timeframe.

### What happens if Delectables do not sell out within the timeframe?
- The unminted delectables will be burned and production for the next season will cease.

### Who is foodmasku?
- @foodmasku is a multimedia artist based in New York City. He is a former Fulbright U.S. Scholar in Indonesia. He created the Instagram account @foodmasku — face masks made from meals eaten during COVID-19 self-isolation — after seeing a fellow artist wear a pickle face filter during a zoom meeting. In response, he placed kale on his face and started posting a food face-mask selfie daily. The project was selected by The New York Times as one of "five art accounts to follow on Instagram now." He has been a top-trending artist in KnownOrigin since the debut of his exclusive series, the Hundred Day Mask Challenge. He is also in the KnownOrigin Hall of Fame
