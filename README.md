## What is Discord.art?
Discord.Art emerged from Taylor.WTF’s original "Diskord" server and collected together different artists and creator communities. It has continued to grow since its inception in June 2021, highlighting artists, collectors, and NFT enthusiasts while also providing a space for their communities! Together, we can interact in three types of spaces here: public, reaction-based, and NFT gated spaces.

## I heard you had events during NFT NYC?
Yes! Discord.Art x Delectable Collectibles has an awesome itinerary of events planned for its members! You just need to join the discord and grab a Proof of Active Participation (POAP) in order to join.
### Discord.Art Co-Working Space
We know you’re in New York for the conference and to party, but maybe you need a place to plug in your laptop or jump on twitter spaces in a quiet area. These are all possible at a co-working space that discord.art has reserved for you to work in! Delectables POAP holders are also eligible to stop in for their choice of one premium handmade coffee, tea, or foodmasku special avocado coffee shake.
### Foodmasku's Food Truck
New York is infamous for its street food. And we’re welcoming you to town with a hot cup of **taylor.wtf** burnt coffee with a **Cake Nygard** pastry. Come by and grab one for free with your POAP. You might even see some guest appearances from our artists!
### Foodmasku Talk
"This artist’s NFTs sell like candy: hear his story!" Come see foodmasku give a live talk at NFT NYC where ALL event attendees are welcome to join!
### Foodmasku Walking Tours 
Take a walk on the hungry side with foodmasku himself! You will be taken on a guided tour of his chomping grounds and end the tour with a live masking. Space will be limited, so delectables POAP holders take priority.
### Armory Art Show 
(Delectables pre-sale POAP holders only)
Because of his multiple donations to the Henry Street Settlement from his NFT sales, the organization has gifted foodmasku several tickets to an exclusive art show at the Park Avenue Armory, one of the most important international exhibiting halls of the century. Space is very limited and exclusive to delectables pre-sale POAP holders.
### Stonewall Inn Discord.Art x CryptoQueers party
Pride began as a riot in the historic Stonewall Inn when a group of queer folk rebelled against a police riot, protesting the discriminatory act of arresting people just because of their sexual orientation and gender expression. The bar has invited foodmasku and discord.art members to have a mellow night upstairs in their piano bar with their resident drag queen piano player. After the show, guests are welcome to party the night away!

More info on event times and locations will be given directly to event attendees to prevent any safety or security issues! We're excited to get a portion the Discord.Art family together in person!

## FAQs

### What are Delectables by Foodmasku?
- A growing collection of food masked people minted on the blockchain - all photos are high resolution and generated with verified randomness.

### How many will be generated?
- Between 2000 to 8000 maximum Delectables could exist. 
- Because foodmasku makes meals into masks and then eats them, the ingredients also depend on what's in season.
- If Season 1 sells out, work will begin on Season 2. If Season 2 sells out, work will begin on Season 3, and so on for Season 4. 
- Each proceeding season will have 2000 more Delectables, up to 8,000 total for the collection within a one-year timeframe.

### Who is foodmasku?
- @foodmasku is a multimedia artist based in New York City. He is a former Fulbright U.S. Scholar in Indonesia. He created the Instagram account @foodmasku — face masks made from meals eaten during COVID-19 self-isolation — after seeing a fellow artist wear a pickle face filter during a zoom meeting. In response, he placed kale on his face and started posting a food face-mask selfie daily. The project was selected by The New York Times as one of "five art accounts to follow on Instagram now." He has been a top-trending artist in KnownOrigin since the debut of his exclusive series, the Hundred Day Mask Challenge. He is also in the KnownOrigin Hall of Fame

## Statement of Inclusion
- We are a supportive community of artists, collectors, and technologists. If you are looking for a place to learn about NFTs and other revolutionary blockchain technology, then we have a home for you. If you are looking for somewhere to argue, this place is not for you.
- As a collective our identities are nuanced and intersectional. We come from different parts of the world, different times in our lives, and with different levels of status. We are committed to ending systemic racism and bias by contributing anti-discriminatory practices within our fields, rejecting unethical design, choosing decisions that will benefit people over profits, and being transparent and taking responsibility when we mess up.
- We are committed to diversity, inclusion and gender equity. We acknowledge that bias is inherent in technology and has historically underserved and exploited women, Black and Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC), LGBTQ+ communities especially transgender/queer/non-binary people, people with disabilities, documented and undocumented immigrants, and the working-class. Technology is only as biased as its makers. As makers, we strive to be proactively anti-racist and to create space where vulnerable communities are welcomed and can thrive.
